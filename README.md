Event RSVP Manager Plugin
Description
The Event RSVP Manager is a simple and intuitive WordPress plugin that allows event organizers to manage event registrations with admin approval. It provides a complete solution for creating events, registering users for those events, and allowing administrators to approve or reject registration requests. Only logged-in users can register for events, ensuring a secure and authenticated process.

Pending Requests Management: Admins can view, approve, or delete pending registrations via an easy-to-use admin panel.
Approved Guests List: Once approved, the users are moved to an "Approved Guests" list, which can be displayed in the admin panel or via a shortcode.
